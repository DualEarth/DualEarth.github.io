        <h2>PhD Opportunities (Apply by January 15th 2025)</h2>
        <p>
            We are currently seeking well-rounded physical scientists with a strong interest in modeling and simulations of Earth's systems, including, but not limited to, hydrology. This PhD is in the <a href="https://geo.ua.edu" target="_blank"> Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Alabama</a>. Candidates do not nessessarily need to have a background in Geology, but they should have some experience in an area related to Earth Science demonstrated through project experience or upper division course work.
            Candidates should have:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Background in Earth sciences, physics, Civil Engineering or related fields</li>
            <li>Strong computational skills with some experience modeling dynamic systems</li>
            <li>Programming experience and an interest to develop these skills</li>
            <li>Science communication skills</li>
        </ul>
