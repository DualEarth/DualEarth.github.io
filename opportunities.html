        <h2>PhD Opportunities</h2>
        <p>
            We are currently seeking well-rounded physical scientists with a strong interest in modeling and simulations of Earth's systems, including, but not limited to, hydrology. This PhD is in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Alabama. Candidates do not nessessarily need to have a background in Geology, but they should have some experience in an area related to Earth Science demonstrated through project experience or upper division course work.
            Candidates should have:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Background in Earth sciences, physics, Civil Engineering or related fields</li>
            <li>Strong computational skills with some experience modeling dynamic systems</li>
            <li>Programming experience and an interest to develop these skills</li>
            <li>Science communication skills</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are interested in pursuing a PhD with us, please reach out with a letter of interest detailing your background, research goals, and relevant experience.</p>
